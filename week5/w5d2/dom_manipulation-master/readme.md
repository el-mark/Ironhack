# DOM Manipulation Exercise

Let's practice some DOM manipulation.

The target is to create a grid with cells that will change color in some pattern.

For example: every 0.5 seconds the the colors change to one color for even cells and to
another color for odd cells.

Open even.html for this example. There is a cooler random pattern in the `random.html`.

The code for each example is in `even.js` and `random.js`.
